P- input: the total amount of swithces as well as the number of iterations. 
   This will be an integer. Ex. 5
   
   output: this will be an array that shows which lights are ON after
   the repetitions. Ex. [1, 4] (two lights on)

  Explicit requirements: at each iteration, the light switches that are 
  multiples of that `n` value will be TOGGLED. It could be on-to-off or off-to-on.

  - though the only input is a single integer, we need to build an array that
  has `n` elements from this single input. 

  - IMPORTANT: the switches start OFF. and they are all OFF
  
  implicit- at each iteration, the previous value (ON or OFF) must be saved and then 
  changed.  


E-

D- we are starting off with a single integer. This will be assigned
to the local variable n. As stated above, from this `n`, we need to construct an array.

- this array will consist of `n` elements. Perhaps we use ten `booleans`, and at end
we convert to integers using index? 

** 2nd idea, dictionarty with keys of integers and values of booleans. **

- of course, the output will be an array object. 

A-

  - we will give an integer object to an initial method. This first method will build 
  out the array object that will represent our 'light' switches. Perhaps we construct 
  an array object with `n` booleans that are false?

  - after we get our inisital array,  we have to iterate through `n` times, and 
  only mutate the elements that are multiples of the current interation. 
  
  This wil be the parameter `cycle`. `cycle` 2 will FLIP/REVERSE the elements that are multiples
  of 2. So mayube we ditch the boolean idea? Or maybe we do a dictionary of key/value?

  - second method, will be reversing a boolean

  Lastly, once we mutate `n` times, we simply return an array.
