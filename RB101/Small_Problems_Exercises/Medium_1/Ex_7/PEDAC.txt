P
  - input: an integer which stands for the nth fib number we want to return
  - output: the fib number corresponding to the nth place

  RULES
  - explicit: method must be recursive

E

D
- we begin and end with an integer
  # in the middle we'll just be doing mathmatics
  # how do we break out?
    - we can send each fib number to an array, and once the size of that array      
      is == to the parameter, we break out

A
- def method and pass in the arugment which will be the 'nth' fib number
  fib = [1, 1]
  # if param is 1 or 2
    return 1
  # elsif param >= 3
    parm.times do |x|
      counter = 1
      n + fib(x)
