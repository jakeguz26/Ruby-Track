P- 
  input: a string that contains multiple words
  output: the second to last word in that string
  
  explcit: return a single string 
          the input will ALWAYS have more than one word
  implcit: spaces dont count, any character counts, including symbols or numbers

E-
  penultimate('last word') == 'last'
  penultimate('Launch School is great!') == 'is'

D- 
  we will start with a string and the result will be a string, but in the middle...
    # might want to consider saving the string as an array of string elements
      - could possibly call the second to last *INDEX* from this array?

A-
  # first we call the method and pass the string to method as an argument
  # inside of method, we can use #split to turn string into array
  # we can then use index to call forward the index at the second to last position
  # we return this result to OG method caller
