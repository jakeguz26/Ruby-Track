# oop gives us more flexibility and allows us to more easily manage a large code base
# also, oop allows us to model real world nouns (player, buyer, pet, account..) as objects within the 
# code. This gives our mental models more clarity. 

# oop also allows us to have a large but restricted code base. This means that though we might
# have many classes, many objects, and many methods, these elements will only interface with
# one another if the developer wants them to. This restriction cuts down on bugs. 

# ----------------------------------------------

# Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
# Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
# It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
# It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
# We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
# As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
